# Cat App

This app will at least track litter and food supplies and remind users to purchase more supplies based on how frequently they scope/replace litter and feed their cats. 
Some things that this app could eventually do:
- Track litter box usage (with pressure or infrared sensor)
- Track when litter begins to smell
- Track cat weight
- Track air quality
